# Deep learning pipeline with NLP

Semantic Analysis on the Fake/Real News Dataset

Played around with the Fake News dataset to learn some nlp basics and eventually tested the performance of the model by evaluation using ML.
Prediction was made on the testing set and later evaluated.

The prediction accuracy : **0.99** (almost)

Tried few:  
* Data cleaning approaches
* Data visualization
* Dataframe concatenation


> The dataset is available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data)

Both NLP and ML analysis has been done on this dataset. 

### NLP
1. Stop words
2. Lemmatization
3. Tokenization
4. Padding

### ML
1. Embedding
2. GlobalAveragePooling1D
