# Working with Graph Data 🌧️
In this folder, I have tried to work with graphs. I converted sentences to graphs and also used some parsing techniues. Additionally, worked with embedded data to perform a very efficient `Faiss` search.

#### Sentence to Parsed Tree

Creating a Parsed tree of a sentence using **`stanford parser`**.

  `parse_tree.draw()
  `
#### Tree to Graph

By performing a breadth first search within a tree, converting the tree to a graph. **`Networkx`** library has been used for the graph visualization.
